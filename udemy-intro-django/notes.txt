1.8 What is a Class
    OOPs - java, python, ruby
    objects - instance (specimen) of a class
    OOP allows you to divid complex problems into smaller sets by creating objects
    objects have a state (properties) and behavious (actions)
        software objects have state (ie. variables) and behaviors (methods/functions)
            ex. lamp (object) has a state (on | off) and behaviour (switching on/off)
    class is a code template used to create objects, classes are a way of grouping together related data and functions which act upon that data
        like a data type, when an object of a data type is created, it's an instance of a class
            ex. car class
                car object - green ford mustang
                car object - red toyota prius
                car object - blue voltswagon golf
